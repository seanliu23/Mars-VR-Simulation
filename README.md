# Mars-VR-Simulation
Experience the surface of Mars through a Virtual Reality Simulation! We used Unity for the game engine and Visual Studio for the C# scripts.
This project was created by Dev Parikh, Kevin Li, Prabhjyot Dhanoa, Ashutosh Chandroth, and Sean Liu(me) for Space Apps Challenge 2018, Kitchener-Waterloo Division.
